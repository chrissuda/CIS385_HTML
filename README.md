# CIS385_HTML
This is the project I have done in CIS385 in BMCC.  
It is a shopping website. Students are required to apply CSS, Javascript and Cookie in this project. And the implentation of a shopping cart  
largely depends on these three techniques.  
Also, Jquery$ is absent here. I will work on it in the future.
